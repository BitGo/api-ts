# Introduction

`api-ts` brings type safety to TypeScript HTTP servers by embracing the "[parse, don't
validate]" philosophy. In addition to validating incoming HTTP requests against your API
specification, `api-ts` also parses raw, less-structured data (like strings or JSON)
into strongly-typed domain objects using the `io-ts` library. Once parsed, you can trust
the HTTP request has passed both [type and semantic validation], ensuring your business
logic is never called with data it can't handle.
